                        The Application Landscape Visualizer is a JavaScript web
                        application that was created by 5 fellow students and me
                        as part of the module &#8220;Advanced Programming&#8221;
                        in spring 2021. It is a prototype for an application
                        that enables companies to visualize and analyze their
                        application landscape.

                            project</a

                        and explore the possibilities of our tool. It is a
                        desktop tool and not really mobile friendly.
                        <br /><br />

                        The Application Landscape Visualizer is used to analyze
                        and manage such complex application landscapes. This can
                        be done by adding, deleting or editing applications in a
                        simple and intuitive way. Furthermore, applications can
                        be set in relation to each other to display hierarchical
                        structures. To keep a better overview, there are many
                        graphical functions. The applications can be organized
                        according to different layout types, the connections can
                        be displayed differently, and the applications can be
                        colored according to different attributes. The graphs
                        can be analyzed to obtain more detailed insights about
                        the hierarchies. Single applications can be isolated and
                        their predecessors and descendants can be explored. In
                        this way, dependencies between applications can be
                        identified and acted upon. By using histograms and heat
                        maps, the data can be observed from different views.
                        This makes it possible to analyze attributes across
                        applications and identify patterns. The Application
                        Landscape Visualizer is a full-stack web application.
                        That means the software runs platform independent in any
                        browser. The software can also be operated on larger
                        mobile devices such as tablets through adding gesture
                        control.

                        The program allows the user to create applications and
                        assign them metadata such as technical owner, start and
                        shutdown date and some more. The attributes listed are
                        of course for illustration purposes only and to
                        demonstrate other functions such as filtering. Other
                        meta attributes can be implemented with simplicity. The
                        available cover all common data types: string values
                        (license), lists (tags), numeric values (version) date
                        values (shutdown date).

                        Users can create filters that cover one or more values
                        (even of different attributes). Any number of filters
                        can be created. They can be combined among each other
                        and also deactivated and then reactivated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users can perform coloring of the applications. Any
                        attribute from the metadata can be selected as a source.
                        As an example, here is shown how the coloring of the
                        attribute ‘Technical Owner’ looks like in our demo
                        landscape:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/color-tech-owner.png" />
                    <p>
                        It is also possible to apply a color gradient to a
                        quantitative attribute:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/color-shutdown-date.png" />
                    <p>
                        It is further possible to isolate a single node and
                        explore the graph from there by showing parent/child
                        nodes.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/isolate-1.png" />
                    <p>
                        Working with a large graph it is useful to see which
                        applications are predecessors or descendants of a
                        certain other application. This can be easily
                        accomplished by adding a color to all parent and child
                        nodes:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/parents-children-1.png" />
                    <p>
                        The histogram can show the distribution of an attribute
                        e.g. the ‘Technical Owner’. It is then shown how many
                        applications have which technical owner. In addition,
                        graph properties can also be shown as a histogram, e.g.
                        the number of inputs to a node.
