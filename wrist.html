                        WristConduct is a project I worked on in winter 2022
                        with two fellow students. We summarized our work in a
                        paper

                        As the title of the paper suggests the project was on
                        authenticating users by their wrist. To do that we used
                        a bone conduction speaker to send a three-second white
                        noise sound signal through the tests subjects wrist and
                        a larynx microphone to record the signal at the other
                        side of the wrist. Using machine learning we trained
                        models to authenticate a test subject.

                    <p>
                        The study was conducted at Frankfurt University of
                        Applied Science. We recorded 10 - 12 recordings of 24
                        participants.
                    </p>

                    The images below show our apparatus in action. The silver
                    cylinder is the bone conduction speaker. The black device on
                    the upper side of the wrist is the larynx microphone. A
                    larynx microphone was used since it does not pick up any
                    surrounding sound that travel through the air, but only the
                    sound waves that come through the wrist.

                    <h1>Model Training</h1>
                    Since we were intrusted in authentication, we built a binary
                    classifier that is trained on one test subject. The
                    classifier either accepts (output 1) or rejects (output 2) a
                    new recording. <br />

                    Since we had 24 participants we created 24 datasets were in
                    each dataset one the recordings of one test subject were the
                    positive samples and all other recordings were labeled as
                    negatives.

                    These datasets are highly unbalanced with about 10 positive
                    to 230 negative samples. So what we did is create 5 datasets
                    for each test subject that hold all positive samples for
                    that subject and 92 shuffled negative samples. <br />
                    Therefore we trained 5 models for each 24 test subjects. As
                    a model we first used a SDG Support Vector Machine with good
                    results. We then used a deep neural network to achieve even
                    better results.

                    Since the data were still unbalanced we also included the
