                        This project was developed as a practical exam of the
                        module “Operating Systems and Computer Networks” of my
                        degree program. It was developed in work with my two
                        team partners over a period of several weeks during the
                        semester.
                        <br /><br />
                        It is a command line level program that visualizes some
                        popular process scheduling algorithms (First Come First
                        Served, Round Robin, Highest Response Ratio Next). The
                        user can create any process he wants. A process is
                        composed of a name, an arrival time and a duration. The
                        given processes are then simulated with a scheduling
                        algorithm chosen by the user and the output is displayed
                        in a Gantt chart.

                        <br /><br />
                        No library was used for the representation of the
                        processes, or the visualization as a Gantt chart. The
                        whole project was done by the team and uses only pure
                        Bash script.

                        <br /><br />
                        My task during the project was to design and implement
                        the scheduling algorithms as well as the module which
                        outputs the result as a Gantt chart. This also included
                        the logic of the data structures that represent the
                        processes and results.
                        <br /><br />
                        You can find the code for the project on my

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-twelve tab-full">
                    <h2>Example:</h2>
                    <p>
                        After starting the script the user is asked if a set of
                        sample processes should be used:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/1_Welcome.png" />

                    <p>
                        If the user chooses No, he can now specify how many
                        processes he wants to create:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/2_CreateProcesses-.png" />
                    <p>
                        The user then enters the name, arrival time and burst
                        time for each process and receives an overview:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/4_Overview.png" />
                    <p>
                        Next, the user selects an algorithm using the arrow
                        keys.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/5_Choose_Algorithm.png" />
                    <p>
                        Now the Gantt chart is displayed. A block stands for
                        time in which a process is executed and a light block
                        for waiting time. In the table below the user gets
                        additional information about waiting time and
                        turn-around time:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/6_Result_FCFS.png" />
                    <p>
                        The user can then simulate the same processes again with
                        a different algorithm if desired:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/7_ChooseNext.png" />
                    <p>
                        When choosing the Round Robin scheduling algorithm, the
                        user must specify a time slice:
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/projects/8_TimeSlice.png" />
                    <p>And finally the result with Round Robin:</p>
