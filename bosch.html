                In the summer of 2021, I was looking for an internship position for a six-month full-time internship
                starting in mid-March 2022. Bosch quickly became my favorite as a global market leader and, in my
                opinion, Germany's most innovative company. I didn't want to work in a company with old-fashioned
                technology, but to be part of a company where brand new products are created with cutting-edge
                technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                One job posting for an internship in particular caught my eye: <strong>Software Engineering Intern for Machine
                Learning Application</strong>. After my application and an MS Teams interview, I was finally offered the position.
            </p>
            <p>
                From mid March 2022 I will start at Bosch Engineering in Abstatt, Germany, in an agile software development team. The team I will be working in is creating a web application that uses various ML algorithms to analyze measurement data from test drives in vehicles.  My main task to project events in high dimensional time series onto a 2D representation using appropriate dimensionality reduction methods, thus enabling the interactive selection of clusters by the user. The respective algorithms are to be integrated into the back-end of the web application.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to take this opportunity to thank my project team at Bosch Engineering who made me feel
                welcome right from the very beginning.
