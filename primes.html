                        Visualization of data has always been a passion of mine.
                        A small script for visualizing gaps between prime
                        numbers I would like to share here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The smallest gap between primes is the gap between two
                        and three, nowhere else are there two primes in direct
                        consecutive order – logically. The gaps between the
                        primes become infinitely large towards infinity – and
                        this can be easily proven. And nevertheless the Twin
                        Prime Conjecture says that there are infinitely many
                        primes which have a distance of two. Prime numbers are
                        simply fascinating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The gaps between the primes follow a purely random
                        scheme and still result in wonderful patterns.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="images/projects/banner_style-1.png"
                        alt="A heat map showing the difference to the next prime."
                    />

                    <p>At the beginning, width and height can be specified.</p>
                    <code>HEIGHT = 5</code> <br />
                    <code>WIDTH = 7</code>
                    <p>
                        The script then calculates the first width*height+1
                        primes. In the next step, the gaps between the primes
                        are calculated and stored in a 2D array with the
                        specified width and height. The array is then visualized
                        as a heat map. The smallest and thus darkest gap between
                        2 and 3 is located at the top left.

                        If the parameters are inserted as in the box above. The
                        result is as follows:
                    </p>
                    <img
                        src="images/projects/mini.png"
                        alt="A heat map showing the difference to the next prime."
                    />
                    <p>
                        The darkest box at the top left is the gap between 2 and
                        3. Following are the dark gaps between 3 and 5 and
                        between 5 and 7. The gap between 7 and 11 is the first
                        slightly lighter gap. The brightest gap (below, the
                        second from the left) is the gap with distance 14
                        between 113 and 127.

                    <img
                        src="images/projects/large_plot_2.png"
                        alt="A heat map showing the difference to the next prime."
                    />
                    <p>
                        The plot has the dimensions 117 * 273 and thus shows the
                        first 31,941 gaps between primes. Therefore, 31,942
                        primes were calculated, among which the largest is the
                        number 375,391. The largest is at the bottom of the
                        plot, approximately in the middle, and is the gap of 112
                        between the numbers 370,261 and 370,373.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2,560,000 Primes</h3>
                    <p>
                        The largest plot I created has dimensions 1600 by 1600
                        and contains 2,560,000 primes, the largest of which is
                        42,216,833. The largest gap is 210.
